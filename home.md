# Major Projects

## Robotic Gripper

My team built an autonomous, bioinspired, robotic hand, dubbed [Tenacity](http://poe.olin.edu/2017/Tenacity/index.html) capable of using variable grip strength to hold objects. I was one of three software engineers and the resident electrical engineer on the team. The project requirements were to include a microcontroller as well as mechanical, electrical, and software subsystems. My role included the electrical system as well as the control code for the arm movements using Arduino C. We also tested out various other amendments to the arm that didn't make it to the final prototype, including specifically computer vision (in C++). You can view the code repository [here](https://github.com/prava-d/RoboticArm).

## Sudoku Solver

Using techniques related to sparse signal procressing - namely, concepts within nonlinear programming and convex optimization - this project solved sudoku puzzles in Matlab. [Here](https://allisonlynnbasore14.github.io/Sudoku-solving-with-sparse-signal-processing/) is a link to the website. You can also view the code files for this project [here](https://github.com/allisonlynnbasore14/Sudoku-solving-with-sparse-signal-processing
).

## FisherFaces

This project used linear algebra create a facial recognition software program in Matlab. We trained two algorithms - eigenfaces and fisherfaces - on available images to determine their accuracy in our class data set. Overall, we found that fisherfaces was slightly more accurate and therefore preferable to eigenfaces, as detailed in the [report](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Module_2_Report.pdf).

## Peer2Peer Ram

We created a peer RAM sharing system for file access (in C) as an alternative to the slower method of getting files from one's own Hard Drive Disk. The report and the code can be seen [here](https://github.com/NickShermeister/SoftSysPeer2PeerRAM).

## Clew App

As part of my Technology, Accessibility, and Design class, I was able to help iterate upon the app my professor, Paul Ruvolo, initially created called [Clew](http://www.clewapp.org/). A team of students and I helped create and prototype some design specifications for future iterations of this app.

## Convolutional Codes

Four our discrete mathematics final, a team of students and I created a convolutional code encoder and decoder (the decoder using the viterbi algorithm) in Python. You can view the report [here](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Report%20and%20Bibliography.pdf) and the encoder/decoder code [here](https://github.com/prava-d/Convolutional-Codes).

## ScreamGame

[ScreamGame](https://prava-d.github.io/SCREAMgame/) is a game we created that requires one player to scream to toggle obstacles while the other attempts to run away. It was written entirely in Python and relied heavily on pygame and pyaudio for its completion. I was also able to test out the use of a neural network input (so that screamed vowels could be taken in as input) to varying success. The code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/nathanieltan/ScreamGame).

## Unix Shell

We created our own UNIX shell in C with support for standard commands, piping/redirection/globbing, and a variety of easter eggs including a LISP interpreter and a text editor.
The report and the code for this project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/anushadatar/SoftSysThinkGridWorld).
