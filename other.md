# Other Research and Teams

## Student-Led Classes

In junior year, I had the opportunity to teach a student-led Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) class. It was a class I had took prior, and I was excited about the prospect of teaching a new set of students important skills, as well as having a hand in developing the curriculum further.

In senior year, a peer and I created a student-led class that we called 'Advanced Algorithms,' specifically catered to those who took DSA and wanted to learn other algorithms. For a year we studied the subject more deeply, created a curriculum, made assignments, and then eventually taught and graded the class. This also conveniently aligned with our humanities capstone, in which we expounded our experiences and advice towards **[student-led classes at Olin](https://pravaolin.wixsite.com/olinslc)**.

## ORCAS

My main involvement in the robotics lab was a team working on autonomous submersible platforms, called **[ORCAS](https://github.com/olinrobotics/orcas/wiki)**. My responsibilities were primarily electrical, firmware, and software tasks, including maintaining the electrical system, updating defunct Python code into C, and writing autonomous control code.

## OARS

I was a lead for the **[OARS](https://meet.olin.edu/olin-isms/olin-aquatic-robot-systems-oars)** project team at Olin for the electrical subteam, but I also occasionally helped OARS leadership and the software subteam with their tasks.

## Visible Light Communication Research

I assisted Professor Siddhartan Govindasamy in visible light communications research, utilizing various electrical (firmware, communications) and software skills (modeling, algorithms). This research aided the publication of two papers: **_[An Integrated Visible-Light and Radio Frequency Communications System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8862074)_** and **_[An 802.11 Compatible Asymmetric Hybrid Visible-Light and Radio-Frequency Communications System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9217371)_**.


## Varied STEM Education Roles

In addition to my experiences as a teacher in student-led classes, I have also served as a teaching assistant in various electrical engineering and software engineering classes, including: Introduction to Sensors, Instrumentation, and Measurement (2017), Quanitative Engineering Analysis I and II - a class that combined linear algebra, multivariable calculus, signals and systems, mechanics, and dynamics (2018), Machine Learning (2019), and Software Systems (2020).

I also occasionally participated in **[IgniteCS at Olin](http://olin-ignitecs.github.io/about.html)**, which is a Google-sponsered program to bring STEM education to disadvantaged students within or close to the Norfolk district.

## RamsayRating

During HackHarvard 2017, three of my peers and I created a humorous program dubbed **'[RamsayRater](https://github.com/RamsayRating/Ramsay2.0).'** It would take in a picture of food and return a Gordon Ramsay tweet expressing his likely opinion of the food. To this goal, we primarily relyed on the Google Vision API and sentiment analysis.

## Google Tech Challenge

I was able to compete in the **[Google Tech Challenge](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/events/tech-challenge/)**, which is a competition that includes various puzzle and coding challenges catered towards computer science and engineering college students. For two years (2018 and 2019), I was able to participate with four other peers and place 3rd and 1st, respectively.

## Varied RoboLab Research

Other than ORCAS, I was also briefly involved in **[Edwin](https://github.com/olinrobotics/hiro)** and **[Lavabot](https://github.com/olinrobotics/Lavabot)**. The former specializes in research in the human-robot interaction field and the latter 

## Brain-Computer Interfacing Research

I worked with a professor to continue research into brain-conputer interfacing. My specific subteam was "Robots" - working on communication between Neato robots and on EEG. Specific skills included in this project involved experimental design, signal processing, machine learning, and data analysis. My involvement mostly centered around reading research papers and keeping a research journal (which has unfortunately since been deleted).
