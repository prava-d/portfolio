Hello! I graduated Olin College of Engineering in 2020 with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (with a specific focus in software engineering). I keep the most up-to-date information about my projects here, but you can also refer to my **[resume](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Prava2020Resume.pdf)** and **[LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/prava)**.

# Minor Projects

## Sleep Stalking

Using phone accelerometer data and machine learning, we made a algorithm to perform sleeping safety analysis. We largely based the algorithm, written in Matlab, on fisherfaces. It was a fairly accurate method of differentiating movement patterns of a person sleeping or not sleeping simply using a phone. the code for **[Sleep Stalking](https://github.com/allisonlynnbasore14/SleepAnalysis)** can be viewed **[here](https://allisonlynnbasore14.github.io/SleepAnalysis/#myHeader)**.

## Database B+ Tree

We explored the use of B+ trees in database management systems. We set out to implement a B+ tree data structure in Python, as well as searching, insertion, and deletion. Our report can be viewed **[here](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Databases_report.pdf)** and our code can be viewed **[here](https://github.com/prava-d/Databases/blob/master/projectBplustree.py)**.

## Digging Deeper

I and four other students conceptualized **[Digging Deeper](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/final_poster.pdf)** as a result of a collaborative design process with farmers in or near the Norfolk county. Digging Deeper is a service that aims to create more community involvement and awareness around farming through a scavenger hunt program where participants gather ingredients from around the farm and then use those ingredients to cook a farm fresh recipe at home. The goal of the service is to increase awareness about where our food comes from and to promote healthy eating in the community, something that was valued highly by many of the farmers we spoke to. In addition to the poster explaining the service, you can view the **[requirements chart](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Requirements_Chart_Final.pdf)** and the **[personal interaction map](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Personal_int_map.pdf)**.

## InteractiveProgramming

**[InteractiveProgramming](https://github.com/prava-d/InteractiveProgramming)** displayed the 2016 presidential candidates and their sentiment towards each other based on views expressed in their tweets. The user can interact with the visual to see examples of negative of positive tweets by the candidate.

## 3D Scanner

A partner and I designed and coded a **[3D scanner](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/3D_Scanner_Lab.pdf)**. While my partner handled the mechanical subsystem of casing the servos and the IR sensiors, I wrote code in Arduino C and Python to perform the 3D scanning of a letter.

## Line-Following Robot
A partner and I created a **[line-following robot](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Section1%2CLab3-Meaghen%26Prava.pdf)** that would follow a black line on the ground using bang bang control and IR sensors. My partner constructed the mechanical subsystem to hold the sensors, while I wrote the control code (in Arduino C) that would move forward and follow the curved line effectively.

## Human Activity Recognition

A partner and I analyzed the human activity dataset to perform human activity recognition using a variety of statistical methods, which yielded varying degrees of success. The code for that can be viewed **[here](https://github.com/prava-d/Data-Science-Final)** and our insights **[here](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Data%20Science%20Final%20Presentation.pdf)**.

## NEATO Robotics Challenges

Using ROS, Matlab modelling, and mathematical concepts within linear algebra and multivariable calculus, I worked with a series of partners on "challenges" using NEATO robots. This involved traversing a **[Bridge of Death](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/BridgeOfDeathDeliverable.pdf)**, climbing **[Mount Doom](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Mount_Doom_Write_Up.pdf)**, and navigating **[The Gauntlet](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Gauntlet_Write_Up.pdf)**.

## Meteor-M N2 Weather Satellite

Our project was to decode weather satellite data from the Meteor-M N2. We used an RTL-SDR and created Matlab programs for digital modulation (OPSK) and a control system (phase-locked looping). The report for the Russian satellite project can be seen **[here](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/ADCFinalProject.pdf)**, and its scripts **[here](https://github.com/allisonlynnbasore14/DecodingMeteor-M2_Satellite_Images)**.

## Baby Warmer

We modelled and experimented with PI control and temperature disruptions (in Mathematica and Arduino C) to create a **[design recommendation report](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Baby_Warmer.pdf)** on the most effective methodology to create a safe and suitable baby warmer.

## Inverted Pendulum

To study the dynamics of an inverted pendulum, we balanced a small segway. This project relyed upon PID control and Mathematica modelling, while the actual code was written in Arduino C. The report can be viewed **[here](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Segway%20Olympics.pdf)**.

## Computer Architecture Projects

The following are a serious of projects that I and a partner finished: these projects involve creating systems by constructing their respective digital logic circuit and implementing them with Verilog.

* **[SPI Memory](https://github.com/arianaolson419/Lab2)**
* **[single-cycle CPU](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/CompArch%20Lab3%20WriteUp.pdf)**
* **[interconnection network](https://github.com/KaitlynKeil/InterconNetwork)**.

## AM Radio

I worked with a team to construct a circuit for an **[AM radio](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/ADC_AM_Radio_Lab.pdf)** to pick up the broadcast of a local sports station.

## Gilbert Cell Mixer

A team and I constructed and analyzed a gilbert cell mixer, which is often used in RF applications for its functionality as a multiplier. The report for this analysis can be viewed **[here](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Gilbert_Cell_Mixer.pdf)**.

## Computer Networks: APL

For a large part of the semester in my computer networks class, I researched APL, a programming language that uses special graphic symbols to represent most functions. For this project I created a **[presentation](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Final%20CompNet%20Presentation.pdf)** and a subsequent report. I also worked on developing code that would help Oliners or interested people write and understand APL in their own working environments.
