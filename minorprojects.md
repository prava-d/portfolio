# Minor Projects

## Sleep Stalking

Using phone accelerometer data and machine learning, we made a algorithm to perform sleeping safety analysis. We largely based the algorithm, written in Matlab, on fisherfaces. It was a fairly accurate method of differentiating movement patterns of a person sleeping or not sleeping simply using a phone. the code for [Sleep Stalking](https://github.com/allisonlynnbasore14/SleepAnalysis) can be viewed (here)[https://allisonlynnbasore14.github.io/SleepAnalysis/#myHeader].

## Database B+ Tree

We explored the use of B+ trees in database management systems. We set out to implement a B+ tree data structure in Python, as well as searching, insertion, and deletion. Our report can be viewed [here](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Databases_report.pdf) and our code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/prava-d/Databases/projectBplustree.py).

## Digging Deeper

I and four other students conceptualized [Digging Deeper](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/final_poster.pdf) as a result of a collaborative design process with farmers in or near the Norfolk county. Digging Deeper is a service that aims to create more community involvement and awareness around farming through a scavenger hunt program where participants gather ingredients from around the farm and then use those ingredients to cook a farm fresh recipe at home. The goal of the service is to increase awareness about where our food comes from and to promote healthy eating in the community, something that was valued highly by many of the farmers we spoke to. In addition to the poster explaining the service, you can view the [requirements chart](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Requirements_Chart_Final.pdf) and the [personal interaction map](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Personal_int_map.pdf).

## Varied Python Projects

While not one concrete project, I have compiled some of my minor yet interesting pieces of Python code. [GeneFinder](https://github.com/prava-d/GeneFinder) is a script that takes long sequences of DNA as strings and returns the amino acid sequences which are most likely encoded by that DNA. [ComputationalArt](https://github.com/prava-d/ComputationalArt) generates random art based on recursive computations of elementary functions. [TextMining](https://github.com/prava-d/TextMining) analyzed inaugural speeches of US presidents to display a word cloud of the most common words used. [InteractiveProgramming](https://github.com/prava-d/InteractiveProgramming) displayed the 2016 presidential candidates and their sentiment towards each other based on views expressed in their tweets.


## Varied Multidisciplinary Projects

The following are a series of projects that involved integration of software, electrical, and mechanical subsystems. A partner and I created a scaled-down [bike light](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Bikelight_Lab.pdf) which involved circuit design and coding an Arduino. Another partner and I designed and coded a [3D scanner](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/3D_Scanner_Lab.pdf) using IR sensors, in Arduino C and Python. Lastly, a partner and I created a [line-following robot](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Section1%2CLab3-Meaghen%26Prava.pdf) that would follow a black line on the ground using bang bang control and IR sensors.

## Varied Data Science Projects

In the past, I have also worked with a series of partners to analyze real-world datasets and generate insights using data science concepts and R. In my specific portions of these projects, I used [LASSO](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Project2Lasso.pdf) and [SVM](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/svmpresentation.pdf). I also worked on a larger project on a human activity dataset to perform human activity recognition using a variety of statistical methods, which yielded varying degrees of success. The code for that can be viewed [here](https://github.com/prava-d/Data-Science-Final) and our insights [here](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Data%20Science%20Final%20Presentation.pdf).

## Baby Warmer

We modelled and experimented with PI control and temperature disruptions (in Mathematica and Arduino C) to create a [design recommendation report](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Baby_Warmer.pdf) on the most effective methodology to create a safe and suitable baby warmer.

## Inverted Pendulum

To study the dynamics of an inverted pendulum, we balanced a small segway. This project relyed upon PID control and Mathematica modelling, while the actual code was written in Arduino C. The report can be viewed [here](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Segway%20Olympics.pdf).

## Varied Computer Architecture Projects

Using Verilog and digital logic circuits, I, along with some partners, created an [ALU](https://github.com/arianaolson419/Lab1), an [SPI Memory](https://github.com/arianaolson419/Lab2), a [single-cycle CPU](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/CompArch%20Lab3%20WriteUp.pdf), and an [intercon network](https://github.com/KaitlynKeil/InterconNetwork).

## Varied Analog and Digitial Communications Projects

As part of an analog and digital communications class, I worked with a team to construct a circuit for an [AM radio](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/ADC_AM_Radio_Lab.pdf) and also decode weather satellite data from the Meteor-M N2. For the latter project, we used an RTL-SDR and created Matlab programs for digital modulation (OPSK) and a control system (phase-locked looping). The report for the Russian satellite project can be seen [here](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/ADCFinalProject.pdf), and its scripts [here](https://github.com/allisonlynnbasore14/DecodingMeteor-M2_Satellite_Images).

## Varied Neato Projects

Using ROS, Matlab modelling, and mathematical concepts within linear algebra and multivariable calculus, I worked with a series of partners on "challenges" using NEATO robots. This involved traversing a [Bridge of Death](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/BridgeOfDeathDeliverable.pdf), climbing [Mount Doom](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Mount_Doom_Write_Up.pdf), and navigating [The Gauntlet](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Gauntlet_Write_Up.pdf). These projects involved Matlab modelling and writing ROS code.

## Gilbert Cell Mixer

A team and I constructed and analyzed a gilbert cell mixer, which is often used in RF applications for its functionality as a multiplier. The report for this analysis can be viewed [here](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Gilbert_Cell_Mixer.pdf).

## Computer Networks: APL

For a large part of the semester in my computer networks class, I researched APL, a programming language that uses special graphic symbols to represent most functions. For this project I created a [presentation](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Final%20CompNet%20Presentation.pdf) and a subsequent report. I also worked on developing code that would help Oliners or interested people write and understand APL in their own working environments.
