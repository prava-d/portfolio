# About Me

Hello! I am a graduate at Olin College of Engineering with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (with a specific focus in software engineering). I keep the most up-to-date information about my projects here, but you can also refer to my resume(TODO) and LinkedIn page(TODO).

### Student-Led Classes

In junior year, I had the opportunity to teach a student-led Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) class. It was a class I had took prior, and I was excited about the prospect of teaching a new set of students important skills, as well as having a hand in developing the curriculum further.

In senior year, a peer and I created a student-led class that we called 'Advanced Algorithms,' specifically catered to those who took DSA and wanted to learn other algorithms. For a year we studied the subject more deeply, created a curriculum, made assignments, and then eventually taught and graded the class. This also conveniently aligned with our humanities capstone, in which we expounded our experiences and advice towards [student-led classes at Olin](https://pravaolin.wixsite.com/olinslc).

### Varied STEM Education Roles

In addition to my experiences as a teacher in student-led classes, I have also served as a teaching assistant in various electrical engineering and software engineering classes, including: Introduction to Sensors, Instrumentation, and Measurement (2017), Qualitative Engineering Analysis I and II - a class that combined linear algebra, multivariable calculus, signals and systems, mechanics, and dynamics (2018), Machine Learning (2019), and Software Systems (2020).

I also occasionally participated in [IgniteCS at Olin](http://olin-ignitecs.github.io/about.html), which is a Google-sponsered program to bring STEM education to disadvantaged students within or close to the Norfolk district.

### RamsayRating

During HackHarvard 2017, three of my peers and I created a humorous program dubbed '[RamsayRater](https://github.com/RamsayRating/Ramsay2.0).' It would take in a picture of food and return a Gordon Ramsay tweet expressing his likely opinion of the food. To this goal, we primarily relyed on the Google Vision API and sentiment analysis.

### Google Tech Challenge

I was able to compete in the [Google Tech Challenge](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/events/tech-challenge/), which is a competition that includes various puzzle and coding challenges catered towards computer science and engineering college students. For two years (2018 and 2019), I was able to participate with four other peers and place 3rd and 1st, respectively.

### Brain-Computer Interfacing Research

Working with a professor to continue research into brain-conputer interfacing. My specific subteam is working on "Robots" - working on communication between Neato robots and on EEG. Specific skills included in this project involve experimental design, signal processing, machine learning, and data analysis. My involvement mostly centered around reading research papers and keeping a research journal (which has unfortunately since been deleted).
