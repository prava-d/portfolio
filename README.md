# About Me

Hello! I am a graduate at Olin College of Engineering with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (with a specific focus in software engineering). I keep the most up-to-date information about my projects here, but you can also refer to my resume(TODO) and LinkedIn page(TODO).

## Main Projects

### Robotic Gripper

My team built an autonomous, bioinspired, robotic hand, dubbed [Tenacity](http://poe.olin.edu/2017/Tenacity/index.html) capable of using variable grip strength to hold objects. I was one of three software engineers and the resident electrical engineer on the team. The project requirements were to include a microcontroller as well as mechanical, electrical, and software subsystems. My role included the electrical system as well as the control code for the arm movements using Arduino C. We also tested out various other amendments to the arm that didn't make it to the final prototype, including specifically computer vision (in C++). You can view the code repository [here](https://github.com/prava-d/RoboticArm).

### Sudoku Solver

Using techniques related to sparse signal procressing - namely, concepts within nonlinear programming and convex optimization - this project solved sudoku puzzles in Matlab. [Here](https://allisonlynnbasore14.github.io/Sudoku-solving-with-sparse-signal-processing/) is a link to the website. You can also view the code files for this project [here](https://github.com/allisonlynnbasore14/Sudoku-solving-with-sparse-signal-processing
).

### FisherFaces

This project used linear algebra create a facial recognition software program in Matlab. We trained two algorithms - eigenfaces and fisherfaces - on available images to determine their accuracy in our class data set. Overall, we found that fisherfaces was slightly more accurate and therefore preferable to eigenfaces, as detailed in the [report](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Module_2_Report.pdf).

### Peer2Peer Ram

We created a peer RAM sharing system for file access (in C) as an alternative to the slower method of getting files from one's own Hard Drive Disk. The report and the code can be seen [here](https://github.com/NickShermeister/SoftSysPeer2PeerRAM).

### Clew App

As part of my Technology, Accessibility, and Design class, I was able to help iterate upon the app my professor, Paul Ruvolo, initially created called [Clew](http://www.clewapp.org/). A team of students and I helped create and prototype some design specifications for future iterations of this app.

### Convolutional Codes

Four our discrete mathematics final, a team of students and I created a convolutional code encoder and decoder (the decoder using the viterbi algorithm) in Python. You can view the report [here](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Report%20and%20Bibliography.pdf) and the encoder/decoder code [here](https://github.com/prava-d/Convolutional-Codes).

### ScreamGame

[ScreamGame](https://prava-d.github.io/SCREAMgame/) is a game we created that requires one player to scream to toggle obstacles while the other attempts to run away. It was written entirely in Python and relied heavily on pygame and pyaudio for its completion. I was also able to test out the use of a neural network input (so that screamed vowels could be taken in as input) to varying success. The code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/nathanieltan/ScreamGame).

### Unix Shell

We created our own UNIX shell in C with support for standard commands, piping/redirection/globbing, and a variety of easter eggs including a LISP interpreter and a text editor.
The report and the code for this project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/anushadatar/SoftSysThinkGridWorld).

## Minor Projects

### Baby Warmer

We modelled and experimented with PI control and temperature disruptions (in Mathematica and Arduino C) to create a [design recommendation report](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Baby_Warmer.pdf) on the most effective methodology to create a safe and suitable baby warmer.

### Sleep Stalking

Using phone accelerometer data and machine learning, we made a algorithm to perform sleeping safety analysis. We largely based the algorithm, written in Matlab, on fisherfaces. It was a fairly accurate method of differentiating movement patterns of a person sleeping or not sleeping simply using a phone. the code for [Sleep Stalking](https://github.com/allisonlynnbasore14/SleepAnalysis) can be viewed (here)[https://allisonlynnbasore14.github.io/SleepAnalysis/#myHeader].

### Inverted Pendulum

To study the dynamics of an inverted pendulum, we balanced a small segway. This project relyed upon PID control and Mathematica modelling, while the actual code was written in Arduino C. The report can be viewed [here](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Segway%20Olympics.pdf).

### Database B+ Tree

We explored the use of B+ trees in database management systems. We set out to implement a B+ tree data structure in Python, as well as searching, insertion, and deletion. Our report can be viewed [here](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Databases_report.pdf) and our code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/prava-d/Databases/projectBplustree.py).

### Digging Deeper

I and four other students conceptualized [Digging Deeper](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/final_poster.pdf) as a result of a collaborative design process with farmers in or near the Norfolk county. Digging Deeper is a service that aims to create more community involvement and awareness around farming through a scavenger hunt program where participants gather ingredients from around the farm and then use those ingredients to cook a farm fresh recipe at home. The goal of the service is to increase awareness about where our food comes from and to promote healthy eating in the community, something that was valued highly by many of the farmers we spoke to. In addition to the poster explaining the service, you can view the [requirements chart](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Requirements_Chart_Final.pdf) and the [personal interaction map](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Personal_int_map.pdf).

### Varied Python Projects

While not one concrete project, I have compiled some of my minor yet interesting pieces of Python code. [GeneFinder](https://github.com/prava-d/GeneFinder) is a script that takes long sequences of DNA as strings and returns the amino acid sequences which are most likely encoded by that DNA. [ComputationalArt](https://github.com/prava-d/ComputationalArt) generates random art based on recursive computations of elementary functions. [TextMining](https://github.com/prava-d/TextMining) analyzed inaugural speeches of US presidents to display a word cloud of the most common words used. [InteractiveProgramming](https://github.com/prava-d/InteractiveProgramming) displayed the 2016 presidential candidates and their sentiment towards each other based on views expressed in their tweets.

### Varied Multidisciplinary Projects

The following are a series of projects that involved integration of software, electrical, and mechanical subsystems. A partner and I created a scaled-down [bike light](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Bikelight_Lab.pdf) which involved circuit design and coding an Arduino. Another partner and I designed and coded a [3D scanner](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/3D_Scanner_Lab.pdf) using IR sensors, in Arduino C and Python. Lastly, a partner and I created a [line-following robot](https://github.com/prava-d/portfolio/blob/main/Reports/Section1%2CLab3-Meaghen%26Prava.pdf) that would follow a black line on the ground using bang bang control and IR sensors.

## Research, Teams, and Other

### ORCAS

My main involvement in the robotics lab was a team working on autonomous submersible platforms, called [ORCAS](https://github.com/olinrobotics/orcas/wiki). My responsibilities were primarily electrical or software tasks, including maintaining the electrical system as well as testing and updating older code.

### OARS

I was a lead for the [OARS](https://meet.olin.edu/olin-isms/olin-aquatic-robot-systems-oars) Project team at Olin for the electrical subteam, but I also occasionally helped OARS leadership and the software subteam with their tasks.

### Visible Light Communication Research

I assisted Professor Siddhartan Govindasamy in visible light communications research, utilizing various electrical (firmware, communications) and software skills (modeling, algorithms). This research aided the publication of two papers: [An Integrated Visible-Light and Radio Frequency Communications System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8862074
) and [An 802.11 Compatible Asymmetric Hybrid Visible-Light and Radio-Frequency Communications System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9217371).

### Student-Led Classes

In junior year, I had the opportunity to teach a student-led Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) class. It was a class I had took prior, and I was excited about the prospect of teaching a new set of students important skills, as well as having a hand in developing the curriculum further.

In senior year, a peer and I created a student-led class that we called 'Advanced Algorithms,' specifically catered to those who took DSA and wanted to learn other algorithms. For a year we studied the subject more deeply, created a curriculum, made assignments, and then eventually taught and graded the class. This also conveniently aligned with our humanities capstone, in which we expounded our experiences and advice towards [student-led classes at Olin](https://pravaolin.wixsite.com/olinslc).

### Varied STEM Education Roles

In addition to my experiences as a teacher in student-led classes, I have also served as a teaching assistant in various electrical engineering and software engineering classes, including: Introduction to Sensors, Instrumentation, and Measurement (2017), Qualitative Engineering Analysis I and II - a class that combined linear algebra, multivariable calculus, signals and systems, mechanics, and dynamics (2018), Machine Learning (2019), and Software Systems (2020).

I also occasionally participated in [IgniteCS at Olin](http://olin-ignitecs.github.io/about.html), which is a Google-sponsered program to bring STEM education to disadvantaged students within or close to the Norfolk district.

### RamsayRating

During HackHarvard 2017, three of my peers and I created a humorous program dubbed '[RamsayRater](https://github.com/RamsayRating/Ramsay2.0).' It would take in a picture of food and return a Gordon Ramsay tweet expressing his likely opinion of the food. To this goal, we primarily relyed on the Google Vision API and sentiment analysis.

### Google Tech Challenge

I was able to compete in the [Google Tech Challenge](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/events/tech-challenge/), which is a competition that includes various puzzle and coding challenges catered towards computer science and engineering college students. For two years (2018 and 2019), I was able to participate with four other peers and place 3rd and 1st, respectively.

### Varied RoboLab Research

Other than ORCAS, I was also briefly involved in [Edwin](https://github.com/olinrobotics/hiro) and [Lavabot](https://github.com/olinrobotics/Lavabot). The former specializes in research in the human-robot interaction field and the latter 

### Brain-Computer Interfacing Research

I worked with a professor to continue research into brain-conputer interfacing. My specific subteam was "Robots" - working on communication between Neato robots and on EEG. Specific skills included in this project involved experimental design, signal processing, machine learning, and data analysis. My involvement mostly centered around reading research papers and keeping a research journal (which has unfortunately since been deleted).
