# About Me

Hello! I am a graduate at Olin College of Engineering with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (with a specific focus in software engineering). I keep the most up-to-date information about my projects here, but you can also refer to my resume(TODO) and LinkedIn page(TODO).

### Student-Led Classes

In junior year, I had the opportunity to teach a student-led Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) class. It was a class I had took prior, and I was excited about the prospect of teaching a new set of students important skills, as well as having a hand in developing the curriculum further.

In senior year, a peer and I created a student-led class that we called 'Advanced Algorithms,' specifically catered to those who took DSA and wanted to learn other algorithms. For a year we studied the subject more deeply, created a curriculum, made assignments, and then eventually taught and graded the class. This also conveniently aligned with our humanities capstone, in which we expounded our experiences and advice towards [student-led classes at Olin](https://pravaolin.wixsite.com/olinslc).

### Varied STEM Education Roles

In addition to my experiences as a teacher in student-led classes, I have also served as a teaching assistant in various electrical engineering and software engineering classes, including: Introduction to Sensors, Instrumentation, and Measurement (2017), Qualitative Engineering Analysis I and II - a class that combined linear algebra, multivariable calculus, signals and systems, mechanics, and dynamics (2018), Machine Learning (2019), and Software Systems (2020).

I also occasionally participated in [IgniteCS at Olin](http://olin-ignitecs.github.io/about.html), which is a Google-sponsered program to bring STEM education to disadvantaged students within or close to the Norfolk district.

### RamsayRating

During HackHarvard 2017, three of my peers and I created a humorous program dubbed '[RamsayRater](https://github.com/RamsayRating/Ramsay2.0).' It would take in a picture of food and return a Gordon Ramsay tweet expressing his likely opinion of the food. To this goal, we primarily relyed on the Google Vision API and sentiment analysis.

### Google Tech Challenge

I was able to compete in the [Google Tech Challenge](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/events/tech-challenge/), which is a competition that includes various puzzle and coding challenges catered towards computer science and engineering college students. For two years (2018 and 2019), I was able to participate with four other peers and place 3rd and 1st, respectively.
